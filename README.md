## History ##
"Simply Logical -- Intelligent Reasoning by Example" by Peter Flach was first published by John Wiley in 1994. It could be purchased as book-only or with a 3.5 inch diskette containing the Prolog programs printed in the book (for various operating systems).

In 2007 the copyright reverted back to the author and book and programs have been freely available [online](https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~flach/SimplyLogical.html) ever since. The print version is no longer available through John Wiley publishers.

In 2015, as a pilot, we ported most of the original book into an online, interactive website using SWI-Prolog's [SWISH platform](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/). Since then, we created the *Simply Logical* open source organisation committed to maintaining a suite of freely available interactive online educational resources about Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming with Prolog. Visit our organisation's [website](https://simply-logical.space/) and [GitHub profile](https://github.com/simply-logical) for more details.

This book is no longer available through John Wiley publishers.
You can download a free PDF copy or view an online version.
